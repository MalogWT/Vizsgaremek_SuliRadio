## Plan
Create a program that creates a local webpage, where students can vote for the songs they'd like to hear, managed automatically or by the host (school)
## Goals
- Host local webpage for voting  
- Program can access music from folders or streaming service  
- Create a list from song loaded  
- Host can edit this list by adding or removing songs  
- Students can access webpage through local wifi or ethernet  
- On the page they can view the playlist and a login section  
- Once logged in, they can vote for songs to be added or to be removed  
- Host can set the number of votes needed for the vote to succeed  
- Host can enable or disable the voting feature (seperate for adding and removing)  
- Host can create a set list to choose songs from, or enable adding songs from streaming services  
- Output audio (maybe integrate DLNA or other stuff)
